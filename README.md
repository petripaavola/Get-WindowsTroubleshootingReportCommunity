## ‚ñ∂Ô∏è Usage Examples

```powershell
# Get only KNOWN Events. KnownEvents categories and time range is selected from graphical UI
./Get-WindowsTroubleshootingReportCommunity_v1.0.ps1

# Get ALL Events. KnownEvents categories, Event logs and log files and time range is selected from graphical UI
./Get-WindowsTroubleshootingReportCommunity_v1.0.ps1 -AllEvents

# From folder with known events only
./Get-WindowsTroubleshootingReportCommunity_v1.0.ps1 -LogFilesFolder "C:\Logs\DiagLogs-COMPUTERNAME"

# From folder with ALL events
./Get-WindowsTroubleshootingReportCommunity_v1.0.ps1 -LogFilesFolder "C:\Logs\DiagLogs-COMPUTERNAME" -AllEvents

# Known events between two times
./Get-WindowsTroubleshootingReportCommunity_v1.0.ps1 -LogFilesFolder "C:\Logs\DiagLogs-COMPUTERNAME" -StartTime "2024-12-02 08:00:00" -EndTime "2024-12-02 18:00:00"

# All events between two times
./Get-WindowsTroubleshootingReportCommunity_v1.0.ps1 -LogFilesFolder "C:\Logs\DiagLogs-COMPUTERNAME" -StartTime "2024-12-02 08:00:00" -EndTime "2024-12-02 18:00:00" -AllEvents
```

<a name="parameters"></a>
## ‚öôÔ∏è Parameters

- `-AllEvents`: Include all events (not just known).
- `-LogFilesFolder`: Folder with multiple .evtx/log files.
- `-StartTime`, `-EndTime`: Specify exact range.
- `-LogViewerUI`: Launch log review UI.
- `-RealtimeLogViewerUI`: Real-time Event logs monitoring UI.
- `-IncludeSelectedKnownRulesCategoriesOnly`: Filter by known rules.
- `-ExcludeSelectedKnownRulesCategories`: Exclude rule categories.
- `-SortDescending`: Sort newest-first.
- `-ProcmonFilePath`: Include Procmon CSV file.

---

<a name="how-it-works"></a>
## üß† How It Works

1. **Log Processing**: Parses event logs and .log files, combines them into timeline.
2. **Report Generation**: Builds interactive HTML report with filters and search.
3. **Known Event Detection**: Uses rules from `EventRules.json`.
4. **Customization**: Build your own rules with `Create-EventRules-GUI-HelperTool.ps1`.

---

<a name="contributing"></a>
## ü§ù Contributing

- Use `Create-EventRules-GUI-HelperTool.ps1` to create `EventRules.json`.
- Add green (success) and red (fail) markers.
- Submit via GitHub to help others.

---

<a name="scenarios"></a>
## üß™ Scenarios

- **Windows Update**: Status, success/fail, reboots.
- **Intune**: Enrollment, sync, script/app information and errors.
- **Defender for Endpoint**: AV definitions and scans.
- **Software Installs**: MSI/Store installs and issues.
- **System Events**: Restarts, sleep, driver changes.

---

<a name="example-reports-coming-soon"></a>
## üìä Example Reports (Coming soon)

- **Timeline View**
- **Filtered Report**: Only known events or categories

---

<a name="guid-resolution"></a>
## üîé GUID to Name Resolution

Reading Intune logs full of random GUIDs? This tool fixes that.

The report can **automatically convert known GUIDs to real, human-readable names** ‚Äî especially helpful when analyzing Intune `.log` files and Event Logs.

### üí° Built-in Translation Features

- **App installation logs**: Converts Intune App GUIDs to their real names. (Built-in)
- **Attack Surface Reduction (ASR) rules**: Recognized and labeled. (Built-in)
- **PowerShell and Remediation Scripts**: Shows actual script names. (Run included tool to download Intune names)

### üì¶ How It Works

1. The tool checks for known GUIDs using `.json` files in the `KnownGUIDs` folder.
2. You can enrich this mapping using a built-in helper script:
   ```powershell
   .\KnownGUIDs\Get-Intune-Apps-and-Scripts-GUIDs-and-Names.ps1
   ```
3. Run the script once to generate a full list of:
   - Intune Apps
   - PowerShell Scripts
   - Remediation Scripts

### ‚úÖ Result

Once mapped, your report will display:
```
Instead of:
  ApplicationId: d8a3bc0d-2342-48b9-a0a1-7bc409b153f3

You‚Äôll see:
  Application: Microsoft Edge (Win32) ‚Äì Install
```

No more digging through Intune manually. Just clear, meaningful names in the report.

üß† This functionality alone can save **hours** of troubleshooting and is completely automated after a quick setup.
